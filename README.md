Hi there!

Somehow, you've landed on my GitHub profile...

I'm in the process of moving over to sourcehut. You can find me here: https://sr.ht/~witcher

If you feel like keeping up with me in any way, make sure to visit my website https://wiredspace.de where you will find a blog, a short wiki and links to various external sites, among other things.

If you are looking for a Rust developer and caught interest in me, feel free to E-Mail me. You will find my E-Mail as well as my PGP key on my website.
