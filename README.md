You can see something here, though: https://git.sr.ht/~witcher.

My GitHub only hosts forks of other projects hosted on GitHub in order to contribute or outdated repositories.
You can find all the up-to-date repositories on my Sourcehut account linked above.

If you feel like keeping up with me in any way, make sure to visit my website, https://wiredspace.de, where you will find a blog and a microblog, as well as links to various websites you can find me on, among other things.

If you are looking for a Rust developer and caught interest in me, feel free to E-Mail me. You will find my E-Mail as well as my PGP key on my website.
